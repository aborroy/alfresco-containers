# Alfresco Containers

This project features sample and practical exercises for the training session *Alfresco Container-based Installation and Configuration Best Practices*, presented at Alfresco TechQuest 2024. It provides Alfresco-related guidance for deploying the platform using Docker Compose and Helm (for Kubernetes).

## Docker
The Docker section covers various essential aspects of deploying Alfresco in a containerized environment:

### [Incremental Deployment](docker-incremental)
Learn how to deploy Alfresco incrementally using Docker. This method allows you to apply changes progressively, ensuring stability and minimizing the time spent handling installation errors.

### [Image Building](docker-image-building)
Understand the process of building Docker images for Alfresco, including creating efficient and secure Dockerfiles. This section guides you through best practices for image creation, optimization, and management to ensure your Alfresco deployment is reliable and performs well.

### [Best Practices](docker-best-practices)
Explore the best practices for deploying Alfresco with Docker. This includes container orchestration, environment configuration, security measures, monitoring, logging, backup and performance tuning. Implementing these practices will help you achieve a robust and scalable deployment.

### [Additional Tools](docker-tools)
Discover additional tools and utilities that complement Docker for managing Alfresco deployments. 

## Kubernetes
The Kubernetes section provides guidance on deploying Alfresco using Helm charts and Kubernetes resources:

### [Deployment](k8s-deployment)
Learn how to deploy Alfresco on Kubernetes using Helm charts. This section covers the setup and configuration of Kubernetes resources, enabling you to leverage Kubernetes' powerful orchestration capabilities for managing Alfresco clusters.

### [Additional Tools](k8s-tools)
Explore additional tools that can be used with Kubernetes to enhance your Alfresco deployment.
